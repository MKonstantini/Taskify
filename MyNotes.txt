MY NOTES - LEARNING NEXT JS V.14

_________________________________


What is Next JS?
An Open-source React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
Allows for both Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation.

Built-In Features:
- Routing: File based routing.
- API Routes: Create APIs.
- Rendering: Supports SSR and CSI .
- Data Fetching: simplified fetching using await in React Components.
- Styling: Supports CSS Modules (.module.css), Global Styles (styles/globals.css).
- Optimization: Optimizes images, fonts, scripts.

What is Vercel?
The Front-End Cloud Platform. Creators of Next JS. 
Offers a suite of tools to build, deploy, and manage modern web applications.
Hosts static sites and serverless functions, has a global CDN, is integrated with Git.

Command Line:
Create Next JS Project: `npx create-next-app@latest`

React Component Types:
1. Client Component (RCC): 
    - Created using "use client" at the top of the component's file.
    - Cannot read or fetch data.
    - Can handle hooks and user interaction.
2. Server Component (RSC): 
    - The default type of components in Next JS. 
    - Can read and fetch data from a DB. 
    - Cannot handle hooks or user interaction 

Special files (file name = functionality):
- page.tsx
- layout.tsx
- template.tsx
- not-found.tsx
- loading.tsx 
- error.tsx
Component Tree:
<Layout> => <Template> => <Error Boundary fallback={<Error />}> => <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
=> <Error Boundary fallback={<NotFound />}> => <Page/>.

Styling:
Create style.css with: @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;
Import style.css in components that require the styling.

Metadata:
Define a page's metadata in layouts and/or pages for improved SEO.
Define statically: export const metadata : Metadata = { title : 'Home' }
Define dynamically: export const generateMetadata = ({params} : HomeParams) : Metadata => {
    return { title : params.id }
}

Layout:
page.tsx = UI that is unique to a route.
layout.tsx = UI that is shared between all pages in/under the the layout's directory.
In layout.tsx:
- Export const metadata = metadata which will be applied to the layout's children (improves SEO). 
- Create and exported JSX that will case all child elements.
- Child elements "children" are the effected pages, and are automatically set as props of layouts.
Create nested layouts via creating additional layout.tsx files within route folders.
Important to note when routing between elements with shared layout (children) - the layout does not unmount-remount.

Templates:
Exactly like layouts, except total unmounting-remounting does occur when routing between its children
(DOM elements are recreated, state is re-established, effects are re-synchronized).
Create a template.tsx file within a directory, receive children, export JSX (like in layouts).

Loading:
Create loading.tsx file, the exported JSX within will be displayed on content loading (specific to route segment).
All page files within the same directory as the loading.jsx will be subject to its exported JSX whenever loading.
This feature implements a React suspense boundary for the effected pages.
Since the layout is above the loading in the Component Tree - the loading page's layout will still be present and responsive!

Error Handling:
Create error.tsx file, like loading.tsx - the exported JSX will be displayed on error in pages sharing directory with this file.
Requires component to be set to "use client".
Here too the layout is above the error element in the Component Tree - the layout will still be present and responsive on page error.
Since the layout is not under the error, errors in the layout will not be covered. 
To handle layout erros, place error.tsx in the directory above the layout.
This feature implements a React error boundary for the effected pages.
Component can utilize received error props:
({ error, reset } : { error : Error; reset : () => void }) => {
    console.log(error.message) (string)
    onClick={reset} (invoke function to re-render the page - requires page to be set to "use client")
}

Routing:
URL paths are defined by the files and folders in src/app.
Important to closely follow the Next JS conventions for creating routes:
- All routes must be placed inside the app folder.
- All folders correspond to a path segment in the URL, except for:
    1. private folders prefixed _ (_stats).
    2. route group folders in brackets ((auth)).
    3. layout props folders prefixed @ for parallel routes (@notification).
- All route files must be named page.tsx (the exported JSX within this file will be displayed).
- Create nested routes by creating folders inside of folders.
- Create dynamic routes (/:id) using [id] as folder name.
- All pages receive route params as intrinsic props - Component({params}) {params.id}.
- Can catch-all URL segments using folder name [...slug] - Component({params}) {params.slug[0]}.
- Adv. catch-all that includes parent folder: [[...slug]].
- 404 Not Found page is created automatically by Next JS.
- Create 404 Not Found page file in src/app/not-found.tsx (will replace the default Not Found).
- Use import { notFound } from 'next/navigation' - a function that routes the app to the nearest Not Found page.
page.tsx in app is the home page (localhost:3000).
page.tsx in app/about is the about page (localhost:3000/about).
Parallel Routing - Display of multiple pages within a layout in the same URL: 
    1. Create folders @something with page.tsx in a directory with layout.tsx (can also push subsequent folders + page in each @something).
    2. Destructure these @somethings as props in the layout ({children, something1, something2}).
    3. In the layout, create a returned JSX with the prop pages as variables.
    4. Create default.tsx files in the layout's directory and in each @somethings to act as a fallback when one @something pushes to the URL (/something/archived) so that the other @somethings will not crash (unmatched URL slots). 
Intercepting Routing - Display a intercepting page instead of the target page when using <Link href='/route to target'>:
    1. Create folder (.)*name of target page's folder* (referably in the same directory as the target folder).
    2. Create a page.tsx within the (.)x folder. This page will be displayed when routing to the target folder.
    - If the new (.)x folder folder is in the same directory as the target folder use a single dot (.) 
    - If the target folder is one directory above the intercepting folder use two dots: (..)x
    - If the target folder is in the app directory use three dots: (...)x 

Navigation:
! Naigational functionalities require components to be defined as client components. Insert "use client" at the top of the page.
- Import Link from 'next/link':
Use the <Link href=''> component (a React extension of the <a> component), imported from 'next/link'.
Can be used inside of other components: <h1><Link></Link></h1>.
- Import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'.
Get a variable of the current active URL extension: const pathname = usePathname() (== '/about').
- Import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'.
const router = useRouter(), then: 
    -> router.replace('/') to navigate to '/'.
    -> router.back()/router.forward().
    -> router.push(/about) 

Route Handlers:
Create RESTful endpoints, for handling API requests (no need for a server). 
Route handlers run server-side, ensuring that sensitive info like private keys remain secure (never shipped to the browser).
Creating a GET request:
    1. In app, create folder *route name* (or folder [id] for /:id just like client routing).
    2. Create file route.ts in the created folder (note: .ts not .tsx). 
    3. Create CRUD operation function. Examples:
    - export async function GET() {
        return Response.json(comments, status: 200)
    }
    - export async function GET(_request: Request, { params }:{ params : { id : string }}) { <- prefixing _ means it will not be used
        const comment = comments.find( (comment) => comment.id === parseInt(params.id) )
        return Response.json(comment, status: 200)
    }
    - export async function POST(request: Request) {
        try {
            const userInput = await request.json()
            if (!userInput.text) {
                return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Missing comment text' }), status: 400 )
            }
            const newComment = {
                id: comments.length + 1,
                text: userInput.text,
            }
            comments.push(newComment)
            return Response.json(newComment, status: 201 );
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error creating comment:', error);
            return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to create comment' }), status: 500 );
        }
    }
    - export async function PATCH(request: Request, {params}:{params:{id:string}}) {
        const userInput = await request.json()
        const index = comments.findIndex((comment) => comment.id === parseInt(params.id))
        comments[index].text = userInput.text

        return Response.json(comments[index], status: 201)
    }
    - export async function DELETE(_request: Request, {params}:{params:{id:string}}) {
        const index = comments.findIndex((comment) => comment.id === parseInt(params.id))
        const deletedComment = comments[index]
        comments.splice(index, 1)

        return Response.json(deletedComment, status: 200)
    }
    - export async function GET(request: NextRequest) { <- import { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'
        const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams 
        // reads query of url: /comments?query=first
        const query = searchParams.get("query")

        if (!query) {
            redirect('/comments') <- import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
        }
        const filteredComments = comments.filter((comment) => comment.text.includes(query))

        return Response.json(filteredComments, status: 200)
    }
